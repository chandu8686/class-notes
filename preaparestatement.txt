How  PreparedStatement  will work internally..?

step-1:  when ever we send the query to the database server by using prepared statement
         then it will first check in the database server cache memory whether the 
         query is exist or not .if not it will load it into server memory.other wise it will 
         perform last step
		 

step -2:it will check the syntax of the query

step-3 :database server will check whether any object is required to execute the query

step-4:the query will be converted(compiled) into the database understandble language

step-5:the database server will be create the different types of the algarithms to 
       execute the different types of operations on database
step-6:the compiled query  and the algarithms  will be loaded into the database
step-7:database server will be pick up the appropriate algarithms for current sutuation and the 
        execute the query.
