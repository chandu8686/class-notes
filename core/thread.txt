=============================================================================
Multitasking :
the Process is is executing the mulitask in same time is called multitasking.then by using of the this we use time optimum way.
The processs is the loading,unloading  into the Memory is called as ContextSwtching.in this multitasking time is divided into the slots for the every task
then it is called as time slicing.
TheADvantages of the Multitaaasking is reduce the wating time and increasing the response time .then automatically the performance of the 
 application will be more .
 Multitasking are the two types they are 
 1) process based the multitasking.
 the Processor will be execute the different proceses with in the same time is called the process based multitasking.
 So in this every process is indipendent each other and they having the own resources .
 
 
 
 
 2)thread based Multitasking.
 
The Thread based multi tasking can be defined as the different parts of the same process can be executed simalteneously with in thw 
same time is called the thread based multitasking but they share the same set of the resources.
*Thread is saparate piece of code and it executed saperatly.

abstraction the abstraction is can be defined as the 
 it is giving the usefull information and hide unnecessary data that would be help u to
reduce the code complexcity and increase the code performance.


What is the inheritence ?
the inheritence is nothing but  aquering the one class numbers into the another class is called as the inheritence.
  compile time errors ?
 

 the errors will be occured due to the syntstical mistakes then it called as the compile time errors 
  Run time errors ?
  the errors wil be occured  due to the programing failure or jvm failure then it is called as the run time errors;
