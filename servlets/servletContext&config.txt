ServletConfig:

Whenever the client sends the first request to the server, the server will look into 
the web.xml and finds out the servlet  that has to be executed. When the servlet has 
to be executed, The servlet has to be loaded into the server memory and then the object
of that servlet will be created.

whenever the server creates an object of any servlet, an object of sevletconfig will 
also be created. When the servlet is destroyed, the servlet object will be removed 
from the server and when the servlet object is removed from the server, its associated
servletconfig object will be removed from the server.

A server can contain multiple applications and every application can contain multiple
servlets but every servlet will have its own servletconfig object.

The purpose of the servletconfig is to provide some initialization to the servlet. 
The data available in the servletconfig object with can be accessed by only that servlet
which is associated with the servletconfig object, the other servlets cannot access 
the data.

To store the data in the servletconfig object we can take the help of tag called
<init-param> which is subtag of <servlet>.

Syntax:
<init-param>
<param-name>name</param-name>
<param-value>value</param-value>
</init-param> 

For Example:
<init-param>
<param-name>sname</param-name> 
<param-value>vamsi</param-value>
</init-param>


ServletContext:
--------------
the servletContext object is a global object for the entire web applicatin. The data
available in the servletContext objectcan be accessed by all the servlets available
in the application. The ServletContext object will be created by the server when the
applicatin is deployed and it will be existing as long as the application is available
in the server. The ServletContext object will be removed from the server when the 
application is undeployed from the server.

The number of sevletconfig objects will be equal to the number of servlets available
in the applicatin. The numberof servletContext objects will be equalto the number of
applications available in the server.

The servletContext object will be available in the server even before the first request
comes to the server. The servletContext can be considered as a shared information
repository, Where the data can be stored into the servletContext object by one servlet
and accessed by another servlet.

We can store the data into servletContext object in 2 ways:
-> During the servletContext object creation time
-> After the servletContext is created
by using the context -param we can store the data inthe ServeltContext Object .


Note:ServletContext Object is teh Global Object any Servlet Can use that .
Synt:
<contax-param>
<param-name>name</param-name>
<param-value>value<param-value>
<context-param>



we can read the Data from the ServeltContext by using the getInitParameter();
or  ();

We can create servletContext in two ways:

servletConfig config = getservletconfig();
servletContext con =config.getservletcontext();

we can access the data from servletConfig by using getAttribute() ; string name 
getAttribute(String name);
