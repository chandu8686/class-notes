note:By using the Cllable,PS,Batch we can increase the performance of application but small differences are 
      there they depends where they using...

How to do the batch execution..& what is the use of batchexecution..?
 
 In previously...we are sending the request to the database it will consider as a new 
  request in the database.then we can  get memory issue in database as well as also 
  there will be load on network.we write the no queries and we can send it to database as a
  single request by using the BatchExecution.

  
  
  
2)CallbleStatement also used to reduce the load on the  network then what is the difference
   b/w CallbleStatement and BatchExecution ...?

In CallbleStatement we will write the queries and bussiness logic in the database .
it's always not recomended  to write the bussiness logic in the database .
to overcame this jdbc interduce the Batch execution.   

3) Simillarly PreparedStatement will also increase the performance but it when ever 
  we have multiple "samequeries " then only we get the benifits of P.S other wise 
  if  we get  every time new query it's also useless
===========================
Batch having the three types of methods they are like:
void addBatch():this is used add the Query to batch Object
int[] executeBatch():is is used to execute the batch 
void clearBatch():used to clear the batch
