Servelet :it's server side technology .which is used to develop the web application.by 
          the help of html and css.
	
how to develop the Servlet Application...?
if we want to develop the servlet application we need to implement the servlet directly 
(or)  indirectly.
A servlet Program can be Developed in 3 ways 
1)Servelet program can be developed by implementing the ServletInterface.
2)Servelet Program can be developed by extending Generic Servlet.
3)Servelet Program can by extending the Http Servet.

Servlet API is introduced in the JEE API.Servlet Api will providing two packages..

1)Javax.Servlet package

Interfaces
1.1)Servlet
1.2)ServletRequest
1.3)ServletResponse
1.4)ServletConfig
1.5)ServletContext
1.6)RequstDispatcher

classes:
1.1)Generic Servlet
	

2)Javax.http.servlet package
Interfaces:


2.1)HttpServletRequest
2.2)HttpServletResponse
2.3)HttpSession

Classes:
HttpServlet

when we developing the servlet application we need to execute it's life cycle method's
1)what are the life cycle methods in the Servlets..?

1)public void init(ServletConfig config)
2)public void service(ServletRequest,ServletResponse)
3)public void destroy()
4)public ServletConfig getServletConfig();
5)public String getServletInfo();



1)init()...

  the init() method will execute only once.when the servlet object is created.
  it will perform initilization job like constuctor.
  or first request come from client to server.servlet object is created when the
  client invoke appropriate servlet url invoke time. it will provide the some information 
  or load data which help servlet lifetime.
  
  
  2)service method:this method is the main method perform the actual operation(bussiness) 
                   because when the request comes from the client the servlet container will
				   call service method.it will create the request and response object
				   process the request by checking the http(get,put,delte..) method and 
				   provideng the response by calling the approprite action methods
				   like doGet,doPost...and send response to client in the form of response 
                    object
3) destroy method():when ever we want remove the servlet from server container we call this 
                   methods	
.
4)getServletConfig();
return object of servletConfig().
5)getServletinfo():this method returns descreption of servlet.
