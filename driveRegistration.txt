How manay ways we can register the Driver....?
we can register the Driver in 4Ways they are 
1)By using the DriverManager
2)By using the Class.forName
3)By using the Predefined System Properties
4)Automatic DriverRegistration
===========================
1)when register the Driver by using the Class.forName then that class will be loaded.
  and  block of the that class will be loaded.
  according to the Sun micro system who implementing the Driver Interface that 
  class must be provide the static block.
  ex:MySql:
  public class Driver1 implements Driver{
   static {
   Driver D= new Driver();
   DriverManager.registerDriver(d);
   }
   }
   
   ex2:Oracle
   public  class OracleDriver implements Driver{
     static{
	 Driver d=new OracleDriver();
	 DriverManager.registerDriver(d);
	 }
   
 2)PredefinedSystem properties:
  public class Registration {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		try {
			
			Connection con = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/ssiet","root","root");
            Statement st = con.createStatement();
            ResultSet rs = st.executeQuery("select * from student");
 //////
 
 java -Djdbc.driver=com.mysql.jdbc.Driver Registration
 
 In above class we did not mentioned the first method.to estblish the connection 
 we use get connection method belongs to DriverManager .to execute getConnection 
 DriverManager class will having the static block it will load the Driver.
 
 public class DriverManager{
 static{
 String driver=System.getPreperty(jdbc.driver);
 Class.forName(driver);
 }
===========================================================
-> 3)Automatic Registration 
 we can add the driver to the class path. so we can register the DriverAutomatically.
