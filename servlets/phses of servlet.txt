Phases of the Servelets:
1)Instantiation Phases
2)Initilization Phases
3)Servicing Phase 
4)Destroy Phase

1)The servletContainer loads the servelet when client sends the request. after
   loading the servet,the ServeletContainer will create instance of the servelet.
   
2)once the servelet will instantiated  then servelt will initilize the servelt by 
 calling the init();before calling the init method it will create the servlet config
object.it will contain the servlet initilization data.it will avilable up to servlet
destroy phase. 

3)service method();
once the servlet is done the first two phases,servlet is ready to serve the request.
to service the request the servlet container will call the service method.before 
invoking the service();,ServletContainer will create the Request object and Response
Object.Servlet request will contain the user information (or ) data send by 
client.by using this we can retrive the data and process teh request .and get the 
response data from database and dump the those data into ServeltRespnse Object.
send back to client.
4)ServletDestroy Phase:
when the servlet is no longer required for servicing the request tehn the servlet
Container will invoke destroy().before servlet is destroyed all resources associated
with the servlet will be released.
