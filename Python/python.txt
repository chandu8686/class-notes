1)What is the Python....?
  Python is highlevel Programing language and Object Oriented & Functional Programing 
  language.it was created by the Guido van Rossum in 1991. this name is came from a
  popular comedy show in BBC channel. the name Monty Python Curcus.
  so it's come in 2 vessions
  Python 2 & 3
 the main differnce between the this two is python 3 is not having backward compatability for p2
  
  1.1)what is the difference between the OOP&FP..?
  
  

2)Why i have to chose the python & why python is more popular...?
what is scope of python...?






Characteristics of Python:

Following are important characteristics of Python Programming −

It supports functional and structured programming lng as well as OOP.

It can be used as a scripting language or can be compiled to byte-code for building large applications.

It provides very high-level dynamic data types and supports dynamic type checking.

It supports automatic garbage collection.

It can be easily integrated with C, C++, COM, ActiveX, COBRA, and Java.


3)what are features of the Python...?

3.1)Easy:
    TO learn the python is very easy because of it simplicity in writing the syntax.
	
3.2)Free and OpenSource:
    No  need to buy the licence.and also have it is free to use and supported by large
	number of python communities. 
	
3.3)Interpreted: 
The translation of single statement of source program into machine code is done by 
language processor and executes it immediately before moving on to the next line is
called an interpreter. If there is an error in the statement, the interpreter terminates
its translating process at that statement and displays an error message. The interpreter 
moves on to the next line for execution only after removal of the error. An Interpreter directly
executes instructions written in a programming or scripting language without previously converting 
them to an object code or machine code.
Example: Perl, Python and Matlab.   
	
3.4)Portble:
   You can run Python on Windows, Mac, Linux or any other platform.
   
3.5)Object-Oriented:
    It supports classes and objects.   
	
3.6) GUI Programming:
    You can use python to develop graphical user interface using dia
3.7)Large Library
   Python provides you with a large standard library. Many academic
   institutions and scientific communities has developed large number of libraries
   which can use to apply for almost all the problems.	
   
   
   

4)What are the benifits of python..?
 1)well testable code.
 2)well maintailble code(because less code more functinality)
 3)open source
 4)lots of frame works for developing applications 
 5)easy intigration with other technologies.
 To many frameworks provided by python for different applications..
ex:
1)Djongo:
  Djongo is the one of the python framework.it's privide the high level open source 
  for developing the web applications.it's take care of hassel of web development.
  so we can concetrate on your bussiness login.no need write the boiler plate code.
  
2)Tornodo:
 it also desined for the webdevelopment.this will provide the high scalebility,
 and high perfomance.

3)Flask:
 this one also one of the pyton frame work for the web development.but sight different 
 then campare to others.it's does not need any certian tools and libraries.and also
 no need form validation,or data abstarction layer.you can make use extensions to
 add extra features.
 clients:Linkedin,pintereste
 
 
 ex:pyramid,Bottle,Numpy,Scipy..like
 

What are the Application we can Develop by using python...?
Console application 
web Applications
ImageProcessing
DataAnalysis
Games






)How to Download the Python..?
https://www.python.org/downloads/
1.go to downloads and install the python.please select the OS.
2.set the class path.....
3.open the command line and type :pip install spyder
===================================================================
Different types of the IDE for python

   KOMODO IDE 
   PYDEV ON ECLIPSE
   BLUEFISH 
   VIM
   gogle colob
   pycharm
  ==== ======================================================================
Drawbacks of the Python:
 1)Python is very slow compared to java.Java is giving the better performance 
   then pyhton.because pyhton is interpreted.
 2)Its'not suitable for the developing the mpbile Applications.because it's like 
   weak while deleveloping mobile computing Applications.
   ex:Carbonnelle.

3)Python has limitations with database access . 
As compared to the popular technologies like JDBC and ODBC, the Python's database
access layer is found to be bit underdeveloped and primitive . However, it 
cannot be applied in the enterprises that need smooth interaction of complex 
legacy data .

4)Python Memory consumption is also high.because it's flexbility of datatypes.

5)it's not suitble for to Develop large Enterprice Applications

6)it's RunTime errors.because pyhton developers need to write more test cases in run time for
  developing the python language .because of it's dynamic datatypes. 
  
Advantages :
1)Beginner's Language
2)Simple and Easy to Learn
3)Interpreted Language
4)Cross-platform language
5)Free and Open Source
6)Object-Oriented language
7)Extensive Libraries
8)Integrated  
 

==============================================================================
 commants 
  1)Single line comments
  
  ex:#this is single level comments
  
  
  
  2)Multiline comments
  ex:''' multilevel comments '''
  ===================================================================
  Statements:
  1)statements in python are nothing but logical line
  
  
  myclg="VWC"
======================================================================  
Veraiables:

The variable is name used to refer the memory location.Veriable can also known as
Identifiers.it can hold some value.
Pyhton has some rules to write the Identifiers.before writing the veariable we 
have to follow the rules.

To assign the data to the veriable we have to use the assignment operator like(=)    
  
 In python we can assign variable in different ways.
 
 1)Assigning the single value to multiple vaeribles:
 ex:
 a=b=c=50;
 print(a)
 print(b)
 print(c)
  
 2)Assigning the Multiple values to multiple Variables 
  
  a,b,c=1,2,3
  print(a)
  print(b)
  print(c)
Python Variables
Gobal variables:
Global variables are declared in out side of the method and inside of the class
we call them as Global variables.we can use it in functions.
ex:

           Class Test:
           name="ram"
           def test():
               print(name)
           test()  

case1:
name="ram"
def test():
 name="rg"
 print(name)
test()
print(name)
o/p:rg
    ram
	
case2:
 name="ram"
 def test():
 print(s)
 name="rg"
 print(s)
test()
print(s)
o/p:Error....unreferenced local 


case3:
 def test():
 global s
 s=234
test()
print(s)

case4:
 a=11
 def test1():
 print("inside test1",a)
 def test2():
 a=23
 print("inside test2",a)
 def test3():
 global a
 a=234
 print("inside test3",a)
test1()
test2()
test3()
