How to create the procedure and function ..?

1.create or replace procedure procedurename()
   as 
   begin 
   statements
   sql queries 
   bussiness logic 
   end procedure
   /
   
   
   con.prepareCall("{myprocedure}")

CREATE DEFINER=`root`@`localhost` PROCEDURE `GetAllStudents`()
BEGIN
SELECT * FROM student;
END



how to call the stored procedure in database..?

Syntax:
CALL PROCEDURENAME
ex:  CALL GetAllStudents 

 we use the Callable state ments to reduce the burden (or) load on the  network .because Jdbc Program will 
 send miltiple Queries to the DB.every is acts like a new request (or) separate Request.if program 
 contains Multiple Queries .therefore multiple Requests.then automatically load will increase on network.
 to solve this jdbc come up with the CallableStatement.because Procedure (OR) Functions  are resides in the 
 database  server and executes in the database server.
Procedure can have the two types of the paremeters.they are
->I/PARAMETER:the I/PARAMETER will represent by the "IN"
->O/Parameter:The O/PARAMETER will be represent as a "OUT"

===================================================
Difference btween the Procedure AND Function
1)Procedure is used too execute the bussiness logic
2)Procedure must not have return type
3)procedure can return 0 (or) more values
4)procedure  have input and output parameters
5)procedure can call function
6)procedure can use try and catch block or perform Exception Hanadiling
7)procedure can not called from selected statements
===========================

2) function
EX:

create or replace function addition(fno in number,sno innumder)
return number 
as 
tno numberl;
begin
tno:=fno+sno;
return tno;
end addition;
/

call like :

          ("{?=call addition(?,?)}")
	

1)Function is used to perform calculation
2)it must have return type
3) it will return only one value
4)functions have only i/parameters
5)it's can't call procedures
6)it will not perform E.Hadiling
7)function can be called selected statement
