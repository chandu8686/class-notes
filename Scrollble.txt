when ever we want to execute the queries by using the Statement first we need to create 
createStatement() object.by using the statement object we can retrive the data in the form
of ResultSet Object.[this object is NonScrollable and NonUpdatable..].

Q1)how we can access the data in both direction & how access the data randomly..?
Q2)how update the database records with out using the Queries...?


Ans) To solve the above problems we need to create scrollble and updatable resultset..
     it will take two parameters they resultSetype it will scroll the resultset.
     and second one is result set concurrency by using this we can update the result set.
 

syntax:

 createStatement(int resultSetType,int resultSetConcurrency)


 
 int resultSetType is classified into two types :  
 
 1)TYPE_SCROLL_SENSITIVE
 2)TYPE_SCROLL_INSENSITIVE
 3)TYPE_FORWORD_ONLY
 
 int resultSetConcurrency:
 
 1)CONCUR_READ_ONLY(by using this we can read the recods only )
 2)CONCUR_UPDATABLE(by using this we can update teh records)
 
 
 
 
 Q3)what is the difference between the TYPE_SCROLL_SENSITIVE & TYPE_SCROLL_INSENSITIVE..?
 
 In TYPE_SCROLL_INSENSITIVE we will get the snapshot of the database any modification or 
 done before or ofter the execution of the query in the database it will not reflect into
 in the current list.
 In TYPE_SCROLL_SENSITIVE  any modification done in the table it will reflect into user
 accessed data .it will come up with special pointer .it will always pointing to the 
 records in database.if we want use this we need primary key in field.
 
 
 
 different types of methods:
 
 1)absolute(int row):this method will move to exact record.
 2)first():it will place the first record
 3)last():it will place the pointer at last record
 4)previous():it will give the previous record
 5)relative(int count):it will move the curser either forword or backword directions
 6)beforeFirst(): it will move the curser to the before first record
 7)afterLast(): it will move the curser to the  afterlastrecord
 8)getRow() : it will give you the exact record
9)refreshRow():it will refresh the record
10)delete():delete the record


  
 .....extra
 
 
 
 
 
 Int resultSetConcurrency:
 
 update :
 
 two methods :
 
 go to exact record :rs.absolute();
 then update record :updatexx();
 then call update method:update();
 
 
 for delete:
 absolute();
 deleteRow();
 
 
 
 for insert ;
 rs.moveToInsert();
 updatexxx();
 rs.insertRow();
