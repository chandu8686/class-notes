Statements:
1.Statement 
2.PreparedStatement
3.CallbleStatement
Note:Statement and P.Statement are used to execute the basic queries,where 
CallbleStatement is used to execute the stored Procedures and functions


ResultSet:
-> when ever the we execute select query for obtain the records it will give the 
   ResultSet Object if we try to print that Object it's give hashCode of the that object.
-> Suppose if want the data inside of the result set Object .it is programmer responsebility 
   like read data from Object.
-> when ever jdbc program execute the query then the query will forword to the jdbc Driver 
   through jdbc program then jdbcDriver will forword the request(query) to database.DB
   will process the Query and retrive the records and forword those to JdbcDriver.
   Jdbc Driver will Create ResultSetObject and put all the record inside ResultSet and 
   forword to the Jdbc Program.remaining work has bees been done by the programmer(read data)
   ResultSetObject will associated with the pointer called "ResultSetPointer" which will be 
   default possinated before first record.
-> as the programmer we need move curser.by using boolean next();
-> if we move to the approprite record we can read the data by using getxx()methods
   getxx(String columnName)
   getxxx(int columnindex)
