how to develop a jdbc Program :
1.we need register the our driver DriverManager.
2.We need To create the connection object.which will help you to establish the connection with database.
3.Create the statement object By using either Statement ana PreparedStatement,callable Statement
4.executing the queries with statement object.
5.Get ResultSet if we needed.
6.close the connection.




To register the Driver,DriverMnager is providing the Static method "registerDriver();"  
it will be register the Driver.therefore it can directly call the "Driver"
registerDriver();it' expects one parameter of Driver Object  Here the Driver is an interface so 
we can no create the Object for Interface.so we can take the help of implementation class like.

To estblish the connction b/w Database server and Client they need a connection.which will get by calling
getConnection(); a static method is avilable in DriverManager so the need some Parameter to get Connection 
it'expect three parameters they are URL:USERNAME:PASSWORD

URL : every database will having the different url depends on their implementation given in the Documentation.

URL:is three parts they like 
suppose ex:for OracleDatabase

oracle:jdbc:thin:ipAddress:port no:servive name


Ipaddress will tells us where the mechine is running in the network
port will help us to find or lacate the program 
service name giving the name to the service
