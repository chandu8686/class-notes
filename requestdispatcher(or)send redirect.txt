Request DisPatching:
it is th process of dispatching (or) transfering request from one servlet to another Servlet
In the process RequestDispatching the request will be partially process by the first 
servlet and the controll will be transfer to the second servlet.and second servlet is
responsible for the sending response to the user .
 because of this we can achive the inter communication between the servlets.
 To do this we need RequestDispatcher Object.so we can get this Object by getRequestDispatcher();
 
 
 
 
 Syntax :
 RequestDispatcher dis=context.getRequestDispatcher();
 dis.forword(request,response);
                (or)
 RequestDispatcher dis=context.getRequestDispatcher();
 dis.include(request,response);
 
 forword(request,response):In this method  first servlet is process the requst to the second
                       servlet second servlet is send the response to the client.
					   
	include(request,response):in this project first servlet process the request to 
                               secondServlet and servlet will process the request and send 
                                back to first servlet and first servlet will send the response 
                                 to client.								
sendRedirect:
we use  sendredirect to transfer the controll from one resource to the another resource.
The request Dispatcher will do same thing .but there is small difference.if resource 
avilable in the same application then there only RequestDispatcher will work other 
wise it will not work.if resource avilable in the same server but in different 
application,(or) resource avilable in the different application in teh different 
server then we use the  sendRedirect();

syntax:
response.sendRedirect("String location");
